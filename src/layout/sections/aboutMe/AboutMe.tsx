            Iâ€™m front-end developer looking for the opportunities to grow
            professionally. Having 1-year background in the B2B field as a
            Internet marketing specialist and 5-months in the IT field as a
            junior frontend developer I have understanding of all the software
            development processes.{" "}

            Being a part of the international teams I developed good
            communication skills. I have experience in creating SPA based on
            React/Redux/TypeScript. Now I am improving my skills in this
            direction and expanding them with new technologies.{" "}
